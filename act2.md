# Act II - A Forest of Secrets

21 years after the vault new mysteries are unearthed half a world away.

## Antremhas Jungles

The rainforest, but bigger. The entirety of this southern continent is covered in lush (and dangerous) forest. The native peoples, known as the Antremhas (though referred to as savages by the colonials), trade with westerners, but can be hostile if found deeper in the forests. Most travelers do not go beyond the beautiful coasts. Many major landmarks (rivers and mountain ranges) have been mapped by explorers, though much of the jungle remains a mystery due to the thick tree cover.

Early explorers were surprised to note that the Antremhas seemed to have access to Looms, or some similar method of extreme physical alteration. Shortly after initial landfall by the Carlisle party (the second major expedition), an abandoned temple was found dug into the sea wall. Of utmost import, however, was the vault found within. Its door was found sundered from within, though with no signs of who, or what, escaped. A small cache of tomes were recovered, though much of the vault’s contents were damaged by the ocean’s advance through its broken entry. The find, however, triggered an explosion of interest for the continent, prompting a new age of colonialism for the Western powers.

New settlements were founded over the next 20 years, the largest being Port Glory. Westward expansion has been continually stymied by the unyielding conditions of work within the jungles, who's very flaura and fauna are hostile. The larger enclaves of the Antremhas also see the foreigners as threats, and many small colonial villages dissappeared into the night.
